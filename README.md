scripts_collection
========

just a couple of handy scripts - one for rotating images from a pool as a Sharepoint web-object; the other is for updating the AD Manager field for all the computers in your OU (or wherever you designate in the script AND have permissions to make the change).

the nature of scripts on ON has changed recently. We will still post ones we find useful here. Contributions are welcome.
